# 2020 Gold Producers
The purpose of this spreadsheet was for an exploratory analysis with no intent for providing stock recommendations. Follow the instruction below to navigate the dashboards highlights in blue.

Section 1: Balance Sheet Metrics

There are four categories based on Kitco’s 2019 Metals & Mining Analysts’ Ratings & Estimates report. Large Capital Senior Gold Producers, Medium Capital Senior Gold Producers, Small Capital Junior Gold Producers, Small Junior Gold Producers. There is a filter on each dashboard regarding the categories. Please select a maximum of two categories for viewing purposes.

A company with a healthy balance sheet indicated solid liquidity and solvency. Liquidity is the availability of liquid assets and cash; solvency is the ability to pay off debts.

Liquidity ratios such as current ratio and cash ratio were used, to measure how much available current assets or cash & equivalents the firms hold in comparison to current liabilities due within a calendar year (12 months). Current Ratios less than 1 indicate liquidity problems the firm may face soon. Cash ratios greater than 1 means the firm can quickly pay off its short-term debts with its cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, firms with liquidity ratios greater than the category average is considered good.

Solvency ratios such as Debt to Equity can showcase how the capital structure of a firm is leveraged toward debt or equity financing. In some cases, a high debt to equity ratio benefits the return on equity, as a firm can acquire more debt while the equity account remained smaller. However, a high debt to equity ratio may indicate a high risk, as the firm is more likely to finance projects with debt. If debts outweigh the income generated, then it poses a risk to the shareholder value. Similarly, Debt to Assets is used to determine the risk of a company. A ratio greater than 1 means the company is highly leveraged and owes more in debts than the value of its assets. A ratio of less than 1 means the company can meet its debt obligation with the sale of assets. Therefore, firms with solvency ratios less than the category average are considered good.

The drop-down bar allows you to select the ratio; you wish to review. Selecting a category filter will prompt the calculation of the industry average. All companies that meet the criteria for the selected ratio will be displayed. However, the graphs are interactively connected with the filter and will only display companies within the selected category.

Section 2: Estimated Operating Cashflow

Researched was collected from each firm’s presentations and annual reports for their 2020 production and AISC (all-in sustaining cost) guidance.  Applying 90% of the live gold spot price, estimated cash flow from operations was calculated.

Use the filter to select a maximum of two categories. 

Hover over each bar for more detail. The “2020 AISC Guidance” data in pink is the total average for all 29 companies. Ideally, the lower the AISC, the higher the profit margin resulting in higher operating Cashflow based on the production guidance. 

Section 3: Profitability

The P/E ratio was collected from Morningstar based on each firm’s 2019 performance. Use the filter to select a maximum of two categories. The size of the bubble chart is based on the firm’s market capitalization. It is essential to reduce the number of firms with the selection of two maximize categories for better visualization. A high P/E possibly indicates a firm is over-values. P/E ratios are subjective and should be compared based on categories with similar market capitalization. A P/E ratio is a multiple; for example, a P/E of 5x means an investor is willing to pay $5 for $1 of the current earnings. 

P/CFPS is based on the calculated operating cash flow. The share price is divided by the [Cashflow from operations multiplied by the shares outstanding]. Similar to the P/E ratio, the P/CFPS is subjective and should be compared in respective categories. It can be used to justify an undervalued firm in comparison to their market cap.

Section 4: Reserves and Risk

Researched was collected from each firm’s presentations and resource and reserve pages on their websites. Reserve quantity indicated longevity of Cashflow, resources where ignored because it may be inferred. Only probable and proven reserves are mineable; therefore, only reserves were accounted for. 

The risk rating was complied using the Fraser Institute rating system; certain regions without ratings were estimated. Risk Ratings reflect geopolitical, taxation, regulatory factors that may affect mining investments. Single asset producers with projects in low-risk regions would be less favorable to investments.
